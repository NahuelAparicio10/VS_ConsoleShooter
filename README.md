# Nahuel Aparicio Del Blanco

The goal of this first-year university project was to create a game using the Visual Studio console. 
I took the opportunity to design a simple shooting game where the player faces off against static enemies on a board. 

I learnt about game logic, game loops and implemented mechanics beyond the basic requirements.
